UOA Part 2 Software Engineering Java Theatre booking system project

A theatre booking system has to manage performances of acts performed by artists in different theatres. Theatres have seats. Tickets are issued for seats for a performance. Any act has a single artist (which may be a group), but an artist can put on many acts, and each act can have multiple performances.

The types of things you can do with the booking system is get IDs for artists, performances, theatres etc. As well as adding a performance, act, artist etc to the server and getting a sales report for all performances of a specified act.
